      Klaus was once an East German Olympic ski-jumper until his brainwaves were switched with that of a
      goldfish in the 1986 Winter Olympics
      by the CIA to prevent him from winning the gold medal. Klaus' human body with the goldfish
      brain headed for a nearby stream, and was later found frozen and allowed to decay by the CIA
      Klaus took up residency with the Smith family, where the CIA ordered Stan to have him pose as their pet,
      a fact Klaus has still apparently not come to terms with.

      Peter's favorite pastime is watching TV.
      Peter also has a habit of proving his masculinity, not wanting Lois to fall for another man.

        Flamboyant and eccentric one year old infant of Peter and Lois Griffin. Mentally he seems much older.
        Stewie is well-spoken, with an advanced vocabulary, an upper-class British accent and an ambiguous sexual orientation.
        He refers to Peter often as 'The Fat man' and his mother by her given name, Lois.
        Despite all of Stewie's evil traits he did genuinely care about Brian.
        He still wants to kill Lois and take over the world but those goals have taken a back seat.

        They also have a long-lost older brother, Patrick, who was sent to a mental asylum after he became a serial killer.
        She met Peter when he was employed as a towel boy by her aunt. Her rich father, Carter Pewterschmidt,
        cannot stand Peter and makes rude comments at every chance he gets. Peter seems to unintentionally do his absolute

        Chris is also willing to do something as drastic as to convert to Judaism order to do better in school.

        after her mother had already selected Megan.
        Meg was originally depicted as the "sweet, teenage daughter" who typically took
        the blame for the terrible things done by the other members of her family.
        However, over the years, the writers stripped Meg down to a desperate teenager who is hardly noticed by her family.
